# Temperature-Extractor-csv-
Temperature extractor from .txt to .csv

Another software to extract information from a repor.txt generated by a third party software (nvidia) to a .csv file.
I used this software to gather temperature information during my stress test on a Nvidia Tesla P4.

Originally I wrote this simple program in Java, which runs on my pc/laptop, but I have created also a version in C# because I couldn't install JRE on a server. However, the C# version is still on an early stage, I decided to improve this version in Java.
